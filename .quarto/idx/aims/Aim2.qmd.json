The MC will also provide supplementary statistical support for Pilot Research Projects as needed. \n\nMajor responsibilities and authorities of the MC include:\n\n  - study design \n  \n  - data management\n  \n  - monitoring\n  \n  - reporting\n  \n  - statistical support\n  \nThe MC will develop the EDC system in coordination with the REDCap support team, train sites in its use, and monitor it to ensure adequate enrollment/retention and data quality and completeness. It will provide logistical support for the study website(s), develop study protocols and forms in collaboration with the AC, ensure proper randomization, plan and carry out statistical analyses, and prepare reports for safety monitoring. \n\nMC personnel will meet regularly to monitor and streamline ongoing activities and make important decisions, with meeting frequency increased as necessary to ensure timely completion of activities. All MC members have offices in Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Biostatistics, which is physically and administratively separate from the AC which is within the Department of Psychiatry at MGH and the Harvard Medical School. Specific functions of the MC are described below.\n\n### 1. Design and implement data and safety monitoring plans.\n\n##### Communications. \n\nThe MC will develop a Manual of Procedures (MOP) for study coordinators in collaboration with the AC. The MOP will contain information on how to 1) screen patients and obtain informed consent, 2) perform the randomization, 3) use the EDC system and case report forms (CRFs), and 4) report adverse events. The MC will prepare sites for trial conduct, including training site personnel in protocol and EDC procedures including a review of Good Clinical Practices, HIPAA regulations, and protection of human subjects. The MC will train clinical sites to comply with reporting requirements to promote standardization of study related procedures.\n \nThe REDCap EDC system integrates site onboarding, training, study documents, and resources in a central location accessible by authenticated users. The MC will additionally develop a distributed communication network (email list server, website) in collaboration with the AC. The website will have a public section with general information about trials and a password-protected section for study staff with study documents (e.g., protocol, MOP), contact information, meeting minutes and agendas, and other important study resources (see Administrative Core component for additional details). The MC will monitor screening, enrollment, and retention throughout the study. If concerns arise, the MC and AC will work with sites to ensure sufficient recruitment.\n\n##### Adverse event (AEs) reporting. \n\nAEs will be ascertained at regular time intervals. Standardized OHRP definitions of AEs and Serious AEs (SAEs) will be used: AEs will be defined as “Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.” SAEs will be defined as “an adverse event that: \n  1. results in death; \n  2. is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); \n  3. results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; \n  4. results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; \n  5. results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or \n  6. based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse) (ORHP, 2005).” \n  \nWe will also note for each AE and SAE whether the event is not study related, possibly study related, or study related. All AEs (and their subtype) will be monitored and documented, and reported to the Center DSMB, IRB, and NIH as required in a given case. OHRP and NIH guidelines for reporting AEs and SAEs will be followed, including reporting unexpected events, related or possibly related events, or events suggesting that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized to the IRB and DSMB within 10 business days.\n\n##### Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). \n\nA Center DSMB including outside experts in the design and conduct of clinical trials and suicide prevention will be established in coordination with NIMH and oversee the conduct of all Center Projects. The Chair of the DSMB will be selected by Drs. Smoller and Nock and will be external to the MGB system and will be required to have expertise in the conduct of clinical trials with individuals at elevated risk of suicide. Drs. Smoller and Nock will provide suggestions for the other DSMB members to the Chair, but the DSMB Chair will ultimately select the other DSMB members. The purpose of the DSMB is to assure independent review as to whether study patients are exposed to unreasonable risk because of study participation, and to monitor study progress and integrity. The DSMB will receive detailed data from the MC as frequently as deemed appropriate by the board, including summary tabulations and narratives of adverse events, and will have periodic teleconferences/webinars with the Study Investigators and the MC personnel. \n\nThe MC will generate a report for each DSMB meeting that will include: \n  1. a protocol description and history, \n  2. site accrual, eligibility, protocol violations, data quality metrics, and gender/minority representation,\n  3. patient characteristics at baseline by study arm, \n  4. completeness of follow-up, \n  5. number and severity of AEs, and \n  6. an appendix describing each serious adverse event and protocol violation. \n  \nThey will have full access to all data, and their recommendations and input will be given high priority and will be incorporated into the study protocol. To this end, the DSMB will meet separately in closed sessions with the MC to review all AE data in relation to each clinical trial to detect any increased frequency of significant AEs that could be study related and decide whether continuation of the trial is warranted. Reports from all DSMB meetings will be submitted to the NIMH Program Officer as part of the progress report and the Partners IRB as part of the annual continuing review process.\n\n##### IRB monitoring.\n\nThe conduct of the study will be monitored by the MGB IRB which will serve as the single IRB. All AEs will be reported to the MGB IRB according to established reporting policies and procedures.\n\n##### Clinical monitoring.\n\nRegular monitoring visits will be conducted during the trial to ensure that the protocol and good clinical practices are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate. The investigator and institution will allow monitors direct access to source documents to perform this verification. Site initiation visits will be conducted to review the protocol, verify that the Site Director and his/her collaborators receive all necessary trial documents for a proper trial conduct, and review the procedures related to CRFs completion and query resolution. Investigators will be instructed about the importance of recording accurate and clean data, avoiding protocol deviations/violations, and retaining subjects in the study. \n\nFollow-up monitoring visits will involve the verification of source documents and reporting of adverse events. Monitors will also verify that an informed consent form is on file for each subject screened, with appropriately dated signatures and all pages present, that all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met for each subject enrolled into the study, and that all the withdrawals and dropouts of enrolled subjects from the trial are reported and explained in the appropriate CRFs. Accrual and retention rates will also be monitored and if these fall appreciably below the projected levels, attempts will be made to identify the reasons. At the end of each monitoring visit, a clinical monitoring report will be prepared by the monitor and sent to the site directors with recommendations to correct problems and/or improve the trial quality.\n\n\n### 2. Support protocol development, study design, statistical analysis and reporting of study findings.\n\nThe MC, in collaboration with the AC and project investigators, will refine the design and analysis of Signature and Exploratory Projects based on any scientific developments, changes, or design/analysis improvements made during the planning phase of each study. In particular, the MC will ensure that any modifications made to the design are met with appropriate modifications to the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and maintain adequate power to address the aims of the study. Once the SAP has been finalized and the study database has been cleaned and locked, the MC and statistical teams embedded within the Signature and Exploratory Projects will perform the analysis of all primary, secondary and exploratory outcomes, all supplementary and sensitivity analyses, and all additional post hoc analyses for the study manuscript(s). The statistical team will collaborate with the AC and site investigators to write the primary study manuscript(s). In particular, the statistical team will write the statistical methods section, report results appropriately in text, tables, and figures, and ensure accurate reporting and interpretation of all statistical analyses and study findings. More broadly, the statistical team will provide statistical expertise and input for all disseminated research reports in print or other media such as abstracts, posters, oral presentations, or news press-releases.\n\n##### Design and analysis of CSRP Signature Research Project.\n\nThe MC will provide design and analytic support for the CSRP Signature Research Project “Effectiveness and Implementation of a Clinician Decision Support System to Prevent Suicidal Behaviors”. The primary goals of this project are to evaluate effects of providing information about risk of patient suicidal behavior to clinicians (Aim 1) and to improve both the predictive accuracy of the model (Aim 2) and treatment optimization among high-risk patients (Aim 3). As detailed in the Signature Project research strategy, we will address these aims by conducting a two-arm randomized trial among patients presenting to the psychiatric ED by randomly assigning patients to their provider receiving (or not receiving) the patient’s risk score. Patient suicide attempts and clinician treatment decisions during the 6-month follow up period will be compared using appropriate two-sample hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-squared tests for proportions). Iterative enhancement of the risk prediction algorithm will be done by expanding the risk predictor set to include NLP and SDOH data and by adopting state-of-the-art ensemble ML methods. We will use an extension of the Super Learner algorithm with instrumental variable methods to evaluate and quantify heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTEs). Qualitative analyses of acceptability and perception of potential barriers to the implementation of this system will be conducted.\n\n##### Design and analysis of CSRP Exploratory Research Projects.\n\nThe MC will provide design and analytic support for all three CSRP Exploratory Research Projects. All three exploratory projects will use mixed methods to assess feasibility and acceptability of their interventions and investigate potential factors associated with HTEs.\n\n1. The goal of Exploratory Project 1 is to determine whether enhanced outreach can reduce suicide attempts as well as suicidal thoughts and behavior after emergency department discharge among high-risk patients. We will conduct a two-arm randomized trial among patients discharged from two high-volume psychiatric emergency departments in the MGB system and compare primary and secondary endpoints using appropriate two-sample hypothesis tests (e.g., chi-squared tests for proportions).\n\n2. The goal of Exploratory Project 2 is to develop an EHR-based suicide risk algorithm for racial, ethnic, and linguistic (REL) minority youth and then enhance this prediction algorithm using SDOH and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) data. These aims will be addressed by collecting and synthesizing EHR/SDOH/CAT data from REL minority youth at two pediatric psychiatric inpatient sites and using ensemble ML methods to develop and enhance suicidal risk prediction among this patient population.\n\n3. The goal of Exploratory Project 3 is to determine the impact of a series of brief, just-in-time interventions in promoting real-time patient use of safety plans and, in turn, reducing the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. We will employ an MRT framework and corresponding statistical techniques [14] to evaluate each intervention, the method (e.g., clinician phone call, automated pop-up) and content (e.g., specific safety plan components) of which will be randomized according to the patient’s current level of suicidal urges and intent.\n\n##### Feasibility studies for Pilot Projects.\n\nThe MC will evaluate the feasibility of all Pilot Project study designs and ensure their appropriateness in answering the particular research questions of interest. Correspondingly, the MC will assist in sample size and power calculations to optimize statistical efficiency of the studies. In collaboration with the Pilot Project investigators, the MC will draft and finalize a thorough SAP for all study aims prior to analysis. The MGB Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) is a centralized data warehouse that gathers clinical information from the MGB hospital system. An online Query Tool allows researchers to explore clinical data through a self-service system in order to assess clinical study feasibility, identify patients for clinical trials, investigate hospital operations and patient care, provide identified patient data with approved IRB protocol, find control patients for previously defined populations, and search clinical notes for specific text terms and phrases in order to identify patient cohorts who have notes/reports that contain the searched text. The RPDR ensures the security of patient information by controlling and auditing the distribution of patient data within the guidelines of the IRB and with the use of several built-in, automated security measures. The online search in real time results in a faster data turnaround with extensive specificity of patient criteria. The RPDR has two related but separate functions: 1) The online query tool provides users with aggregate numbers of patients that meet user-defined characteristics and criteria such as diagnoses, procedures, medications and/or laboratory results; and 2) The Data Request Wizards allow the user to ask for more detailed medical record information on the identified patient population.\n\n\n### 3. Biostatistical analysis support for CSRP research projects.\n\nThe MC team will capitalize on their extensive track record of successful collaborative clinical biostatistics research and their diverse expertise in developing and implementing sophisticated statistical methods to support all phases of the CSRP Research Projects. The following describe some analytical tools we anticipate using.\n\n##### Summary statistics and data visualizations. \n\nPrior to fitting statistical models and applying more sophisticated statistical methods, it is critical to carry out a thorough exploratory analysis to identify potential data entry errors and outliers, assess underlying data assumptions, and refine existing and formulate new hypotheses based on any trends and patterns identified. The MC will integrate standardized user-friendly tools for calculating descriptive statistics (e.g., means, SDs, min/max), cross-tabulating data (e.g., R x C contingency tables), and performing basic data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) into the analysis pipeline. We will also work with Co-Investigators on implementing state-of-the-art visualization tools for deeper data exploration including complex phenotype data (e.g., ggplot2, highcharter, RGL available in R and PhenoTree [15]). \n\n##### Methods for longitudinal, multivariate and survival outcomes. \n\nTo better understand and improve prevention strategies, we will collect and analyze continuous, discrete and survival outcomes over time. Proper statistical analysis and interpretation of these data will require implementation of longitudinal and survival methods to account for within-person correlation, time-varying exposures and confounders, missing data, censoring, and competing risks. Longitudinal data are often subject to dropouts. The MC team has a wealth of experience implementing complex models for randomized and observational data, such as Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) [16], Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) [17], and Cox proportional hazards models, investigating innovative methods, and developing software tools to facilitate their implementation. To handle longitudinal data with dropouts, we will consider weighted GEE methods, as well as selection models [18]. \n\n##### Interpretable Machine Learning (ML) approaches for high-dimensional data. \n\nWe will provide the statistical toolbox that employs a variety of cutting-edge ML methodologies to handle high-dimensional data, including (1) regularized regression methods which performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting [19-21]; (2) ensemble learning such as random forests [22] and its scalable and distributed implementations, such as XGBoost [23]; (3) gradient boosting, which combines a series of decision-trees that focus on errors of the preceding trees and can flexibly model variables in various formats along with their missingness [24]; (4) high-dimensional disease risk score algorithms, which assess both investigator-specified predictors and proxy indicators without pre-specified grouping of the individual codes [25]; (5) artificial neural network models that use a series of layers successively representing the initial data inputs, through feature extraction, transformation, and aggregation, which are then connected to an output layer that produces predictions or classifications for relevant clinical end points. Neural networks can flexibly input and model a variety of data formats [26-28]; (6) Super Learner (SL) that forms a set of predicted values based on the optimal weighted combination of a set of user-specified prediction models [29]. SL has been shown to perform asymptotically as well as or better than the best performing user-specified model in terms of minimizing the cross-validated loss function for a specified measure of predictive performance [30]. We will emphasize interpretability in using ML methods to analyze the data.\n\n##### Missing data methods. \n\nMissing data presents a considerable challenge in the analysis of real-world data (RWD), as which data availability is determined by the real-life interactions of patients, healthcare providers, and the health systems in which they operate [31]. Some patient characteristics are known to be widely underreported or missing (e.g. smoking status, race/ethnicity) [32]. Because a patient in worse health is more likely to seek care, RWD are highly susceptible to informative missingness. While standard missing data methods (e.g., multiple imputation) are widely available, principled methods for conducting sensitivity analyses are needed to assess the impact of informative missingness. We will work with research teams to implement tools that utilize not-at-random fully conditional specification [33] and population-calibrated multiple imputation [34], both of which have been successfully used EHR studies in the presence of informatively missing data.\n\n##### Marginal structural models to address immortal time bias and time-varying confounding. \n\nRobust causal inference methods are needed to answer several key questions that arise in the suicide prevention context. Analyses that naively stratify patients by whether they were ever “exposed” are subject to immortal time bias and time-varying confounding [35]. The MC will implement marginal structural models and g-estimation, which are highly versatile tools for appropriately handling these biases [36].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../gread.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"Aim2.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","page-navigation":true,"theme":["lux","../gread.scss"],"grid":{"body-width":"1000px","margin-width":"250px"},"title":"Aim 2: Research Studies","jupyter":"python3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
