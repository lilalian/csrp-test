It allows:\n\n- feature representation\\\n- information extraction\\\n- uncertainty quantification\n\nThe ARCH algorithm first derives embedding vectors from a co-occurrence matrix of all EHR concepts and then generates cosine similarities along with associated p-values to measure the strength of relatedness between clinical features with statistical certainty quantification. In the final step, ARCH performs a sparse embedding regression to remove indirect linkage between entity pairs. \n\n<img  class=\"centered-image\" src='/images/ARCH.png' width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"> \n\n\nClick [here](https://app.parse-health.org/ARCH/) to load the ARCH web app.\n\nYou can also find the KESER app [here](https://dev.parse-health.org/shiny/kesernetwork/).\n\n",
