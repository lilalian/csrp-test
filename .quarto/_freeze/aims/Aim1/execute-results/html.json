Data collection and resources\n\n#####  **Collect data from multiple sources.** \nThe Signature, Exploratory, and Pilot Research Projects will utilize data from a variety of sources, including: structured patient and provider-level survey data; EHR data; wearable device data; and geocoded data. These will be used to abstract data on patient-level socio-demographic factors, medical and treatment histories, and psychiatric symptoms, etc. required for each research study. Although the availability of comprehensive data from such a multitude of sources presents exciting opportunities to study a variety of clinical hypotheses, substantial effort will need to be devoted to collection and management of these data to ensure high standards for data quality, consistency, and accessibility across different projects.\n\nThe Signature, Exploratory and Pilot Research Projects will leverage four primary data components: \n\n  1. EHR data elements including structured data and unstructured narrative data. Structured\nelements will include demographic data (age, biological sex, race/ethnicity, language), insurance type, medication prescriptions, lab results, and ICD10 codes as well as dynamic data treatment intensity\nand timing. Natural language processing (NLP) will be performed on\nthe narrative notes to search for mentions of clinical concepts related\nto suicidality. We will select EHR common data elements (CDEs) that are expected to be common across healthcare settings, thus optimizing potential for broad implementation of a ML-derived risk prediction algorithm\n\n  2. Research survey data, primarily collected via REDCap electronic data capture, including key patient-reported outcomes measured at the point of care and over time, as well as provider survey data\n\n  3. Geocoded data, including small area sociodemographic and Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data\n\n  4. Wearable device data, including physiological data obtained from wrist wearables and smartphones.\nDevelop Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system and ensure data security and protection. Once the study protocol and draft case report forms (CRFs) have been completed, reviewed, and approved by the AC and site investigators, the MC will create them in the REDCap EDC system and test them in collaboration with the AC and site investigators. REDCap is a HIPAA-compliant EDC system with multiple levels of security features ensuring access control, audit control, data integrity, user authentication, and transmission security. REDCap allows for data entry from most devices through a web browser/application. Access to the EDC system will require user accounts with strong passwords and only approved personnel will hold such an account, in order to ensure scientific independence between the MC and AC. The MC will develop, refine, and finalize all research protocols and CRFs for the trial with the AC.\n\n\n##### **Monitor EDC system and maintain data completeness, accuracy and integrity.** \n\nData quality and logic checks will be built into every step of data acquisition, capture, transfer, and integration to assure scientific rigor and minimize potential errors. Whenever possible, automated logic checks will be built into the EDC system. The MC will additionally manage and oversee the REDCap EDC system with regular data checking, cleaning, and quality control. REDCap allows the MC to communicate directly with site coordinators and query questionable/missing fields. The MC will manage user accounts and access to the EDC system. Data backup will be performed by the institutional data centers. The MC will also monitor and maintain web-based randomization tools for the clinical trials associated with the SIG Project and Project EXP1 to ensure their proper use throughout the study. Randomization codes will be integrated in MetricWire (see below) for EXP3.\n\n\n##### Implement mobile data collection platform. \n\nThe MetricWire mobile data collection platform will be used to implement the micro-randomized trial (MRT) and collect smartphone survey (ecological momentary assessment – EMA) for EXP3. After downloading the MetricWire app onto their smartphones and logging in with a randomly generated ID/password, participants will begin receiving prompts from MetricWire to complete 6x/day EMA surveys on their smartphone. Each time they complete an EMA survey, participants will be “micro-randomized” (according to probabilities that the study team will program into MetricWire) to one of several brief, just-in-time interventions aimed to promote real-time safety plan use. Interventions will either be delivered within the MetricWire app (e.g., an automated pop-up message containing a recommendation reminder to use the safety plan [any and all included components] or a specific component of the safety plan) or by a member of the study team outside of the app (e.g., a phone call).\nMetricWire has an API, which will allow the study team to access and ultimately store data collected by MetricWire at MGB.\n\n##### Collect, process, and analyze passive monitoring data from smartphones and wearable biosensors. \n\nContinuous passive monitoring data will be collected via both the MetricWire app and a wearable biosensor in EXP3. These data will complement the longitudinal self-report data collected from participants, providing objective indicators of relevant constructs to SRB and related affective experiences, thus potentially improving tailoring of the just- in-time interventions and short-term suicide risk prediction during critical the high-risk period following hospitalization. Specifically, MetricWire will passively capture whether or not the participant opened (and time spent viewing) their safety plan (a primary target of the just-in-time interventions being tested in EXP3). These objective data on safety plan use will be examined as secondary indicators of target mechanisms in EXP3. Continuous physiological and behavioral data will be collected with the Fitbit Charge 5 and corresponding smartphone application (Fitbit Inc.) in EXP3. \n\nThese data will be used to explore potential contextual moderators of just-in-time intervention effects in EXP3, and may also be leveraged in future pilot feasibility projects to be launched within the Center that are, for example, aimed to detect short-term suicide risk and advance just-in- time adaptive intervention development. The Charge 5 is a commercially available wrist-worn device that includes accelerometer, heart rate, and electrodermal activity sensors. The Fitbit Inc. app is an Android- and iOS-compatible app that is used to sync the Fitbit data to a secure cloud server. The device connects to the participant’s smartphone to upload Fitbit data to the smartphone. The data are encrypted and secured on the phone and quickly uploaded. Fitbit Inc. uses Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) to encrypt and transfer data.\n\nWe will use Fitabase to manage the data obtained through the Fitbit. Fitabase is a data management platform app that is designed to support research projects using wearable and internet-connected devices. Once a device is connected to Fitabase through the associated wearable (e.g., Fitbit) mobile app, the device's data syncs as soon as the wearable service makes the data available. Fitabase can track physical activity, sleep, and heart rate, and uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt data transmitted between the browser and web server. Data, made available through Fitabase will be processed and used to compute candidate moderators of just-in-time intervention effects (e.g., novel digital phenotypes incorporating physiological data) in EXP3. These data may also be used for future just-in-time intervention refinement and leveraged in to-be-named pilot projects designed to improve short-term suicide risk prediction post-psychiatric hospitalization.\n\n### 2.  Data Synthesis.\n\n##### Curate and harmonize EHR data.\n\nReal-world data from EHRs are especially complex and often require careful curation and processing to map raw features available in the data into concepts and variables of interest. To facilitate building scalable and generalizable ML algorithms we will use an ontology-driven approach to transform source codes from the EHR into standardized groupings, including Phecodes, AHRQ CCS codes for diagnosis and procedures, RXNORM ingredients and VA drug class for medications and LOINC codes for lab tests and medications. These groupings are a derivative of vocabulary mappings used for ACT and ODHSI mappings and are continually maintained to include new codes. These code groupings are optimized for effective feature selection as well as for developing meaningful embeddings of the features space. \n\nUsing the ontology, we can generate compact data representations across the entire EHR dataset of over 5 million patients spanning more than 20 years of data. We have used this dataset, named RPDRml, to develop risk prediction models for suicide attempts and other phenotypes. We have also developed embeddings to enable feature selection and portability across research patient data repositories [2]. To run NLP on over 200 million notes across 3 million patients, we will use a scalable NLP pipeline based on state-of-the-art components that run on Apache Spark. \n\nThe PhenoNLP pipeline supports development of computable phenotypes and risk prediction algorithms in EHR data and is focused on fast named-entity recognition with appropriate modifiers. In addition, using public sources and existing literature, we have developed a semi-curated NLP dictionary of diverse terms relevant to suicidality for use in suicide ML models. We have used the PhenoNLP pipeline with this dictionary to extract NLP mentions of suicide related concepts from all 3 million patients. For a smaller subset of patients in a specific clinical setting (e.g. ED patients with psychiatric diagnoses), we will consider more comprehensive NLP feature extraction tools such as NILE that have been successfully used in EHR modeling [3].\n\n##### Generate Geocoded data\n\nEHR data will be linked to a set of community-level demographic data relevant to suicide prediction using Proc GEOCODE in SAS, which uses street addresses to merge to Federal Information Processing Standard Publication (FIPS) codes. We categorize community-level data into four sets of factors: \n\n  1. Psychosocial factors, including: % White residents; Theil Index (a measure of residential segregation), % single female-headed households; and % owner-occupied homes. County-level psychosocial factors include number of robberies per 100,000 and # of social associations per 10,000, such as civic, religious, political, or sports organizations; \n  2. Economic factors, including: \n    a. % families living in poverty, and \n    b. % of cost-burdened renters. County-level economic factors are rate of food insecurity, % of residents on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and the 2011-2015 unemployment rate;\n  3. Built environment factors at the block group-level, including: % residents taking public transit to work; % residents that moved into the area between 2000 and 2009, % vacant rental units, and limited access to supermarkets;\n  4. Health-related factors at the county-level downloaded from the Area Health Resource File including: # of Federally Qualified Health Centers; # of hospital beds per 10,000; # of ED visits per 10,000; and # of psychiatrists per 100,000.\n\n\n\n##### Curation of Patient-level SDoH Variables\n\nIn addition to the geocoded SDoH data described above, we will collect additional patient-level SDoH information from two additional sources: self-report patient surveys (SIG, EXP1, EXP3) and from EHR notes via NLP available for all projects. We have been developing an advanced pipeline for predicting SDoH based on codified and NLP EHR features, but can also use available methods such as Moonstone [4, 5]. We are familiar with current efforts to identify SDoH by applying NLP to EHR, as also are familiar with the limitations inherent in doing so. Specifically, clinicians often do not inquire about SDoH when interacting with patients (e.g., income, neighborhood factors, etc.) and thus such factors are often unavailable in notes and consequently not detectable by NLP. To address this issue, we will use the patient self-reported SDoH data we collect to validate our NLP pipeline and also to quantify its limitations in capturing the full range of SDoH features. We also will test and quantify the incremental predictive value associated with the inclusion of each type of SDoH data (geocoded, NLP, self-report) and their combinations in our models.\n\n\n##### Derive suicide risk scores\n\nEHR data will be combined with patient self-report data to derive suicide risk scores using a recently developed and validated machine-learning approach [6, 7]. A rapidly developing body of research has shown that by applying ML algorithms that incorporate data from dozens of risk factors to patient health data available in EHRs, we can dramatically improve the prediction of which patients will make a suicide attempt or will die by suicide in the period after a given healthcare visit. For instance, we examined predictors of suicide deaths that occurred within the 12-months following hospital discharge in a sample of 40,820 soldiers admitted for hospital care using ensemble ML methods (i.e., regression trees; lasso, elastic net, and ridge penalized regression) to create a prediction algorithm for post-hospital suicide death [8]. Our cross-validated prediction model demonstrated a high level of accuracy (AUC=.85-.90). In fact, those identified by our algorithm as representing the 5% of the sample at highest-risk accounted for approximately 50% of all suicide deaths over the next year; expanding that group to the 10% of patients at highest-risk accounted for 63% of all such suicides. In work conducted in the MGB healthcare system, including ~2M patients, we trained and validated a Naïve Bayesian Classifier model that detects 45% of all suicide attempts and deaths with 90% specificity (AUC=.77) on average 3 years in advance[6]. \n\nWe demonstrated the scalability of this approach, showing similar levels of predictive accuracy when replicating this modeling approach in five different healthcare systems from across the United States.[7] In a large (N = 2000) prospective study of patients recruited in the MGH Psychiatric ED, we compared clinician predictions to our ML risk algorithm combining EHR data with a brief patient survey at the point of care[9]. The ML algorithm substantially outperformed prospective clinician predictions at both 1 month and 6 months following ED discharge. [6, 7, 9-11]\n\n\n### Application (App) Development.\nThe goal of this aim is to leverage existing infrastructure at MGB to build an App platform for suicide risk prediction and prevention. This platform will serve as a base for clinical Apps that will be used during implementation and assessment of the initiatives and trials described in the CSRP research projects and serve as a sustainable platform for downstream clinical decision support Apps in the MGB health system. Since our original submission, MGB made a large investment in this platform, and we now have an initial, prototype “App” on which we will continue to build. The App integrates patient-reported data with EHR-based ML models, generating a summary score which is surfaced to clinicians. The App then allows for a custom care-plan to be developed for that patient based on the generated risk score. The App is directly integrated into our EHR (Epic Systems, Inc) and also writes back clinical notes to our EHR. In this aim, we will extend the functionality of this App to support the work of the CSRP.\n\nTo ensure a smooth integration of our App into provider and patient workflow, the App development team will meet regularly with clinical stakeholders both in and outside the CSRP, to understand workflow considerations as the App is developed. We will also work with the CSRP Stakeholder panel to incorporate perspectives of individuals with lived experience, healthcare system leaders, and community partners. Development will be done through agile software development methodologies, such that the App can quickly change based on user feedback. To facilitate the technical integration, we will continue to use the Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART) HL7 international specification for App launching [12] within or directly adjacent to our EHR, which will reduce provider burden because our App will launch within existing EHR workflows. Additionally, we will explore using Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Hooks, a standard for integrating CDS into EHR workflows [13]. Data is captured using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), an HL7 international standard for clinical data modeling and exchange. \n\nAs a result of using SMART and FHIR, our App is designed, from the beginning, to be portable to other EHR environments. Since SMART on FHIR is mandated for certified EHRs under the 21st Century Cures Act and subsequent Final Rule, this will enable our App broad scale and reusability once developed, across nearly all EHRs. Wherever possible, we align with the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) roadmap, which specifies structured data elements that are to be made available via App Programming Interfaces (APIs) to end-users. Similar to SMART on FHIR, aligning with USCDI will provide transportability of our App to other EHR environments. Finally, we plan to open-source the App using a public repository such as GitHub and add the App to public App listings such as the SMART App Gallery. Through the CSRP, we will disseminate the software to the broader healthcare community, providing a tool that can be adopted across healthcare systems on a national scale (Aim 4).\n\n",
